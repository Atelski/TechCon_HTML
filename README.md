# TechCon_HTML
TechCon Conference 2024 Website

This project challenges me to build a comprehensive website for the TechCon 2024 conference using HTML. I’ll create various webpages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the conference, while incorporating essential HTML elements and best practices.

Project Scope:
The website will consist of five core webpages:

Homepage (index.html): This is the landing page that introduces TechCon 2024 and provides navigation to other sections of the website.
About Page (about.html): This page delves into the history, mission, and notable speakers of the TechCon conference.
Schedule Page (schedule.html): This webpage presents a detailed schedule of conference events, sessions, and speakers in an accessible table format.
Register Page (register.html): This page offers a user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the TechCon conference.
Contact Page (contact.html): This webpage provides comprehensive contact information for TechCon, including email address, social media links, an embedded map, and a “Contact Us” form.
Concepts Covered:
Throughout this project, I’ll gain practical experience with the following HTML concepts:

HTML Structure: I’ll solidify my understanding of fundamental HTML tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and their proper usage for website structure and organization.
Headings and Text: I’ll learn to structure headings (h1-h6) for emphasis and utilize paragraph tags (<p>) and other text formatting elements effectively.
Links and Navigation: I’ll implement hyperlinks (<a> tags) to create navigation menus and link between different webpages within the TechCon website.
Tables: I’ll create a well-formatted table on the Schedule page to present conference schedules in an organized and easy-to-read manner.
Forms: I’ll design user-friendly registration and contact forms using the <form> tag and various input types (text, email, password, checkbox) to collect attendee information.
Images and Multimedia: I’ll incorporate images (using <img> tags with appropriate alt attributes) to enhance the visual appeal of the website. I’ll also explore embedding a promotional video (using the <video> tag) and an interactive Google Map (using <iframe>) on the Contact page.

By successfully completing this project, I’ll gain valuable hands-on experience building a real-world website with HTML. This will serve as a solid foundation for me to explore more advanced web development concepts like CSS and JavaScript in the future.
